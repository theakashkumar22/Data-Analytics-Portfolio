# Superstore Inventory Optimization Case Study

This project analyzes the Superstore dataset to optimize inventory, tailored for a Trainee Analyst role at MathCo.

## Objective
Identify high- and low-performing product categories/sub-categories to recommend inventory adjustments using Python.

## Tools
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Steps
- Aggregated sales by category and sub-category.
- Visualized sales trends with bar plots.

## Findings
- Technology (e.g., Phones) drives high sales, warranting increased inventory.
- Low-sales sub-categories (e.g., Bookcases) suggest overstocking.
- Recommendations: Adjust stock levels and explore marketing for low performers.

## How to Run
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
jupyter notebook
